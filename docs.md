- **Cortexvia Metric Definitions**

  | Metric  | Full Form             | Example                                     |
  | ------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
  | **TPS** | _Tokens Per Second_   | `150 TPS` = ~150 tokens/sec                 |
  | **RPM** | _Requests Per Minute_ | `60 req/min` = 60 requests every 60 seconds |
  | **RPD** | _Requests Per Day_    | `20K req/day` = 20,000 daily requests       |
  | **TPM** | _Tokens Per Minute_   | `100K Tokens/min` = 100,000 Tokens/minute   |
  | **TPD** | _Tokens Per Day_      | `6M Tokens/day` = 6 million Tokens/day      |

---

- **Additional Notes**
  - **Request:** A single API call or message completion counts as one request.
  - **Speed Tier:** Defined by _TPS_ â€” higher values mean faster model performance.
  - **Limits Reset:** RPM and RPD reset every minute and day respectively.
