## Key Features

Cortexvia stands out with a rich set of features optimized for AI developers. Below is a detailed overview of each feature, including how to use it and why it's valuable.

### Data Ingestion and Uploads

- **Drag-and-drop Uploads**: Simple and secure interface for documents (PDF, Doc, Txt, html, etc.) and YouTube URLs. Supports batch uploads for efficient onboarding.
- **Preprocessing and Indexing**: Automatically extract text, generate vector embeddings using models. Stored securely in a vector database for fast retrieval.
- **File Support.**: Compatible with multi-file formats, including multimedia for YouTube transcripts and audio to text conversion.

Why it's valuable? Saves developers time on data prep; just upload and query. Integrates with the RAG SDK for custom preprocessing workflows.

### Intelligent Querying and RAG

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Core engine that retrieves relevant chunks from your data and feeds them into an LLM for context-aware answers.
- **RAG variants**: Basic RAG for straightforward retrieval; SmartRAG (hybrid search with JINA for better realtime ranking); LightRAG for lightweight embeddings on edge devices; GraphRAG under the hood for knowledge graph-based queries.
- **Results Polishing**: Auto-generated answers with citations to source data chunks, streaming support for live chats.
- **Query Optimization**: Supports multi-step queries and filters (e.g., date range, keyTokens) for precise results.

Why it's valuable? Reduces hallucinations in AI outputs by grounding responses in your own data. Perfect for knowledge bases, customer support, or research.

### Multi-Model Integration and Inference


- **Unified Calls**: Single API endpoint for all Model API operations: generate, chat, embeddings, reranking.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Automatically select models based on speed tier, prompt style, or cost optimization.
- **Streaming and Batching**: Support for live streamed outputs and batch processing for throughput.

Why it's valuable? Enables portability across Model APIs with minimal setup. Prototype your app on one provider and switch suppliers with ease.

### Usage Tracking, Analytics and Dashboard

- **Dashboard View**: Real-time visualization of Word usage, cost breakdowns, and api calls.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up custom alerts for limit breaches or excessive usage.
- **Reporting**: Export custom reports in CSV, PDF, or integrate with tools like Slack/Dash/Graphana.
- **Prefistion Analytics**: Anonymized tracking for performance insights, with opt-in for debugging.

Why it's valuable? Track and optimize your AI usage to stay within budgets and improve efficiency.

### Secure API Key Management

- **Generation and Revocation**: Create dedicated Keys for Data (RAG) and Model (inference) applications, with one-click revocation in case of breaches.
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions: read-only, write to uploads, or limited queries per key.
- **Audit Logs**: Track all key usage with timestamps and IP for compliance and auditing.
- **Security Best Practices**: Auto-expiring keys and threat detection integration.

Why it's valuable? Prevents common security issues like key sharing and enhances control for teams or enterprises.

### Advanced RAG Toolkit SDK

- **Unified SDK API**: One-command for all RAG operations, exposurable in JavaScript, Python, and native Node.
- **Embeddings and Reranking**: Integration with models for vector similarity search and post-retrieval sorting.
- **GraphRAG Specific**: Build knowledge graphs from text data for complex relational queries.
- **Custom Vector Stores**: Support for Pinecone, FAISS, or self-hosted storage for hardware-portable deployments.

Why it's valuable? Streamlines RAG workflows with advanced techniques, reducing boilerplate code and improving accuracy.

### React Chatbot Library

- **Easy Embedding**: Plan and play component for React apps, with no additional styling required out of the box.
- **Real-time Context**: Utilizes Data API for dialogue management, supporting memory and previous message context.
- **Customization**: Themes, placeholders, error handling, and callbacks for sectors/buttons.
- **Accessibility.**: ARIA compatible, keyboard support, loading states, and mobile responsive design.

Why it's valuable? Add conversational UIs to your app in minutes, ideal for websites, mobile apps, or dashboards.

### Speed Optimization and Tiers

- **Tiered Inference**: Choose from Normal (200â€“500 Tokens/sec), Medium (700â€“1000), or Fast  for web-scale performance.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamically adapt to load, reducing latency during peak usage.
- **Word Estimation**: Predict and optimize Word use before calling models to stay under limits.

Why it's valuable? Balances speed and cost, ensuring fast responses for user-facing apps.

### Easy Installation and Setup

- **NPM-Based**: Install via Package manager with zero-config for most use cases.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Relies on standard N.bs and fetch for API calls.
- **Self-Hosting Options**: Deploy on VER, Kubernetes, or your own server for data privacy.

Why it's valuable? Reduces boilerplate build time and deployment across environments.

### Flexible Backend Support

- **Compatible Frameworks**: Integrate with FastAPI (Python), Express (Node.js), or any REST API server.
- **Proxy Config**: Adapt to your backend for server-side RAG/personalization.
- **Subscriber Support**: Additional hooks for custom authentication or data storage.

Why it's valuable? Allows full-stack control with your existing tech stack.

### Developer-Friendly Documentation
